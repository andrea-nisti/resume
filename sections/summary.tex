\begin{cvparagraph}
Motivated roboticist with international experience and a strong multidisciplinary background. Since the beginning of my academic journey, Iâ€™ve developed the ability to adapt across domains, gaining a broad perspective on problem-solving. I began my career as a researcher in aerial robotics, building a solid foundation in mathematical modeling, C++ programming, and core technical skills. I then transitioned to a startup environment as a software developer, where my versatility proved essential. Currently, I work in autonomous driving as a C++ developer in the perception team, focusing on state estimation and sensor fusion as well as tooling development such as Software In the Loop frameworks for autonomous driving. My diverse experience has made me a quick, adaptable learner, eager to grow further in robotics and related fields through continuous collaboration and learning.
